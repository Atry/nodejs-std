# Std haxe lib for node.js

Partner to the [nodejs haxelib](http://lib.haxe.org/p/nodejs).

Pulled from Ritchie's node.js github libraries.  There doesn't seem to be a canonical haxe std lib to match the nodejs haxelib.  Many of the existing libraries have an unknown status, or have migrated to other projects.

I've focused on the Http and related classes for now since these are most important for Node.js.
